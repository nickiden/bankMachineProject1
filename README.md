# bankMachineProject1

## Description
I am using this little application to practice C++. In this project I will create functions and get user commands to navigate the back machine system. easy peasy. For project 1, the goal was to use simple preciples and demonstraite clean code. Later I will take this project and expand on C++ concepts

## Design notes
1. Modulated functions to seperate each task. One function manages the menu display while the other manages user input.
2. Inline commenting and header comments are used to describe the process. someone with no coding experience should get an idea what's going on.
3. Validation is used to manage what the user inputs and what can be withdrawled.
